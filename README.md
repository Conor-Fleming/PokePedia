# PokePedia
This is small application written for submission for the hackathon at [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/). I would classify myself in the over 1 year of coding category. The requirements of the submission were: 
- Written in Python3
- Make use of the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

I wanted to participate but wanted to keep it simple as the time alotted was short and I also had work on the day of submission.

The application acts as a basic encyclopedia for any Pokemon. Enter the name of a Pokemon to view a list of its Name, Height, Weight, Abilities, Moves, Forms, Species, and Types.
